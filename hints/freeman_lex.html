        I have no idea how to start solving this mission.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You should find word indexes for first and second letters and check them
        for conditions. 
    </div>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        What instrument should I use to find these indexes?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You should use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_find.asp">find()</a> string method.
        For the purpose of this mission find() is better then <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_index.asp">index()</a>
        string method, because in case of absence letter in word, find() return 
        -1, while index() raises error.
<br>
<br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
i = word.find(first)
j = word.find(second)
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        Ok, but I don't understand, how to check these indexes for the conditions
        if the mission?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        The function should return True if both letters present in the word,
        not equal and the first occurrence of the second letter is right after the
        first occurrence of the first letter. Else return False.
<br>
<br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
return i >= 0\ # first letter present in the word
        and\ # conditions should both be True
        j == i + 1 # second letter goes right after first, 
                   # it should be present in word for this.
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Ok, how my final solution should looks like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        For this you just need to join previous code hints and add function
        definition:
<br>
<br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def goes_after(word: str, first: str, second: str) -> bool:

    i = word.find(first)
    j = word.find(second)

    return i >= 0 and j == i + 1
        </pre>
        There are a lot of other solutions for this mission you be able to see
        when your solution passes all tests successfully, for example:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
goes_after = lambda w, f, s: f+s in w and w.index(f)==w.index(s)-1
        </pre>
        Letters should be together present in the word. Or:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
goes_after = lambda w, f, s: -1 < w.find(f+s) <= w.find(f) < w.find(s)            
        </pre>
        The f+s should be present in the word and the first occurrence of it
        should be not after then first occurrences of first and second letters.
